  - "I filled my waterskin two days ago, such did I record in my memoirs! Yet my
    mouth is dry as ash and there\u2019s but a drop of water left. I cannot recall
    drinking, nor can I recall spilling like a fool. Could this damnable maze have
    clouded my mind to forget such an error? Nay! For even in my most drunken state
    I never forget my duty as a writer!  Could it be that even with man\u2019s intellect
    and magic at my disposal, I am still at the mercy of this wretched tree? That
    my body is treated like a drop of dew, of which the tree soaks in to sustain
    itself and grow? If so, I am truly the butt of the cruelest joke. This is my
    punishment for wasting too much paper. "
  - "What have I done? My love is dead. We marched for three days through these brambled
    tunnels before he halted and fell to the ground out of exhaustion. I couldn\u2019t
    even bother to turn around as I shambled onward. His pained rasps calling out
    my name, his words nearly drowning in wet dirt, they will haunt me for what little
    time I have left. What kind of monster am I? Did our sacred vows to each other
    mean nothing? The flame my love kindled, that filled my heart with joy and wonder
    which no magus could ever invoke, was it merely a fantasy if I would snuff it
    for a few more moments of hopeless survival? No, it must be the tree. This abomination.
    It doesn\u2019t grow from its roots in the ground. It feeds off of our souls. "
  - "Gods save me, for I can see it. The heart of the tree. I am nowhere near it,
    as I still struggle through these wretched corridors, yet the heart taunts me
    by burning itself into my sight. It radiates through the thick cavernous walls,
    searing and engulfing my mind in indescribable agony when I glance at its hellish,
    inconceivable form. Not even closing my eyes rids me of its eldritch sight.  
    Please\u2026no more. The pain is too much. I\u2019d do anything to make the pain
    stop, even if it meant carving my eyes out. "
  - "This isn\u2019t a tree. It\u2019s a living creature, masquerading itself as
    part of the green. Its branches are arms, stretching through the clouds of the
    Paroxysmal Realm to claim the skies for its own. Its roots are veins, spreading
    and robbing the earth of its gifts to nature. The creature is a non-thinking
    primal beast, as ancient as reality, merely in its infancy and undergoing a quest
    to consume all of reality. This is not a tree. It is a cancer.  To whomever reading
    this: It was foolish of you to think you could stop it. And you cannot turn back.
    This is your last great adventure. "
  - "I dreamt I dug through the roof of these caves with my bare fingers. My hands
    were gored and broken as I clawed my way through the dry earth, only to emerge
    to a blood-red wasteland. The trees of the forest have turned to splinters, and
    the mountains in the far ranges to gravel. The oceans were pitch-black, rotten
    fish bloating the surface, cushioning the fall of seagull carcasses raining down
    through ash clouds. The world had turned to a husk so dead, that not even fire
    could kindle.  I journeyed this dead world, its never-ending desolate fields
    and blackened oceans. My stomach twisted from starvation and my tongue cracked
    from lack of water, yet I did not die. And every time I thought I\u2019d ventured
    far enough, I\u2019d turn around and see that cursed tree, no further away than
    it had been before my journey. Part of me wished desperately that it was mocking
    me, and keeping me as its plaything. Part of me wished that there was a semblance
    of purpose in this torture. Yet deep inside, I knew the truth. There was no method
    to the madness, and my suffering was pointless.  As I write my recollections,
    a new thought appears. Maybe this was no dream. Rather, a premonition. "

    green belly Eats it raw, Rash does, eats it alive, Rash does squirming, screaming,
    pained little squeaks are music to Rash in big green belly Feels nut-eater heart
