  - "I filled my waterskin two days ago, such did I record in my memoirs! Yet my
    mouth is dry as ash and there\u2019s but a drop of water left. I cannot recall
    drinking, nor can I recall spilling like a fool. Could this damnable maze have
    clouded my mind to forget such an error? Nay! For even in my most drunken state
    I never forget my duty as a writer!  Could it be that even with man\u2019s intellect
    and magic at my disposal, I am still at the mercy of this wretched tree? That
    my body is treated like a drop of dew, of which the tree soaks in to sustain
    itself and grow? If so, I am truly the butt of the cruelest joke. This is my
    punishment for wasting too much paper. "
  - "What have I done? My love is dead. We marched for three days through these brambled
    tunnels before he halted and fell to the ground out of exhaustion. I couldn\u2019t
    even bother to turn around as I shambled onward. His pained rasps calling out
    my name, his words nearly drowning in wet dirt, they will haunt me for what little
    time I have left. What kind of monster am I? Did our sacred vows to each other
    mean nothing? The flame my love kindled, that filled my heart with joy and wonder
    which no magus could ever invoke, was it merely a fantasy if I would snuff it
    for a few more moments of hopeless survival? No, it must be the tree. This abomination.
    It doesn\u2019t grow from its roots in the ground. It feeds off of our souls. "
  - "Gods save me, for I can see it. The heart of the tree. I am nowhere near it,
    as I still struggle through these wretched corridors, yet the heart taunts me
    by burning itself into my sight. It radiates through the thick cavernous walls,
    searing and engulfing my mind in indescribable agony when I glance at its hellish,
    inconceivable form. Not even closing my eyes rids me of its eldritch sight.  
    Please\u2026no more. The pain is too much. I\u2019d do anything to make the pain
    stop, even if it meant carving my eyes out. "
  - "This isn\u2019t a tree. It\u2019s a living creature, masquerading itself as
    part of the green. Its branches are arms, stretching through the clouds of [INSERT
    SKOGNAVN] to claim the skies for its own. Its roots are veins, spreading and
    robbing the earth of its gifts to nature. The creature is a non-thinking primal
    beast, as ancient as reality, merely in its infancy and undergoing a quest to
    consume all of reality. This is not a tree. It is a cancer.  To whomever reading
    this: It was foolish of you to think you could stop it. And you cannot turn back.
    This is your last great adventure. "
